## Learning Video Editing
My Notes

•	Figure out the audio of the track first. Infact if possible lay down the music, dialogues etc first. And then start cutting video to it.
•	Edit parts of your video as separate sequences and then add them later to the final sequence. This helps in applying effects to overall sequences
•	Warp stabilization doesn’t work if the frame size of clip is not same as sequence.
•	Use cinespace 25/50 from lumetri looks to get photo filter look to your video
•	To add an effect to multiple clips – copy or select the effect parameter, select multiple clips and pull/copy over the effect to all of them.
•	It is possible to change volume of different clips using the audio mixer. To use keyframes with volume – do it in the timeline.
•	Horizontal flip can be a lifesaver to keep the continuity
•	Make sure all your sound and video clips fade in/out with black sections
•	There will always be certain clips in the footage that you love and would be blinded to ruining your sequence to add them. Don’t. get over it!
•	If you cant connect different parts of story flawlessly in a single video, use episodes or chapters – even within the same video.
•	It’s fun to make 720p videos when you have full hd videos – gives you the scope to pan and zoom. Future – 4k to full hd
