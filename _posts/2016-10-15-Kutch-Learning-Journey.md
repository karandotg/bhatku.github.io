# The Kutch Touch

## Why This Journey
यही सोच रहती बचपन से कि Music तो अपने से नहीं होगा। फिर भी कभी एक बांसुरी खरीदी और अपने bag में रखना शुरू कर दी। 
लोगों से छुपकर उसको बजाने की कोशिश भी करता। I would make very annoying sounds. Then one day a guy named alex ने अपने साथ jam करवाया।
क्या मज़ा आया उस रात। खूब दिल से बजाया और alex ने पूरा सहन किया और साथ में अपना गिटार बजाने की कोशिश भी की।
मुझे लगा की कुछ हो सकता है। फिर करीब एक साल तक खुद से practice करता रहा। कुछ teachers के पास गया पर मज़ा नहीं आया।
और मैंने यह तो सीख ही लिया था की बुरे teacher (जिससे मेरा मेल न बने) से बिना टीचर ही भला। खुद से सीखना शुरू किया।
सरल से सवाल – what makes something musical? How do you make music for certain mood?
Then I got introduced to Hindustani classical music. पता चला की यह तो पूरा संगीत ही personal expression और improvisation पर based है। इसके बारे में और पढ़ना और सुनना शुरू किया। Then finally I found a teacher in Bhopal some months back. वहाँ काफी मज़ा आ रहा है। अभी तो सिर्फ सुर पकड़ना और कान तेज़ करना सीख रहा हूँ। 
During all this I fell in love with flute and music in general. थोड़ा confidence भी बढ़ा।
अब यह तो पता चल गया की आगे और कुछ हो न हो पर बांसुरी होगी जब चाहूँ इसका आनंद उठा सकता हूँ।

वैसे मैं ढूंढ रहा हूँ की how does one create music? What goes behind creating your own songs?
Although right now I don’t pay much attention to songs. But I see music as a language and
I want to learn more and more how to express in it. Classical music तो थोड़ा explore करना शुरू किया ही है।
इच्छा हुई की folk musician से भी मिलकर देखना चाहिए। वो कैसे संगीत को सीखते हैं और इस भाषा का अपने जीवन में प्रयोग करते हैं। और यह जो सूफी singers इतने गहरे भजन गाते हैं इन का जीवन कैसा है?
कुछ दिनों पहले मूरालाला जी को सुना था। ज्यादा नहीं कुछ 2-3 गाने। और बस मन बनाया की इनके पास ही जाया जाये। 

## What I saw?

###MERA TO KOI GURU NAHI

One afternoon I was speaking to mooralal on creating music. Mooralaa practices the Bhajan music which relies on compositions set to poetry by saints.
‘Why don't you create your own bhajans? Your own music?’
‘I'm not literate’
‘You may be illiterate but you know the language surely’
‘But I havent found a guru’
‘You have been doing this music for more than 20 years I am sure you can go further without a guru
‘’No no not a music guru but a guru for the soul, I havent found that. Without it I am lost. अभी तो मैं माया में लगा हूँ, यह घर, खेत, shows इन सब की तावरी कर रहा हूँ। Everything I say will be superficial – भेखरी भाषा।’
I went looking for inspiration for my journey into music. I wanted to see how do folk musicians learn and create music. 
And here I find this man in his 50s whom everybody finds exciting as a musician. But he doesn’t see the inspiration yet. He hasn’t found that thing which will get him to make his own songs.


###THE MUSICIAN IDENTITY
Conflict with identity - am I capable of being musician ()?
My tags to myself have been - non-musical, out of beat, tone deaf and other such names. Still there are doubts somewhere - that am I musician enough to be even learning music? It's strange I am liberal and non-conforming in many areas of my life but here I face huge difficulty. 
For this trip I decided that if anyone asks me to play - I will play. Let them suffer. It's their problem that they asked for it. I warned them - that I am learning. 
Also since I would be improvising - and I really don’t understand right now what I am improvising. It's quite a conundrum if I am playing anything in retrospect.
At the nai taleem school, rapar everyone treated me like a musician for two days. Everywhere I went I was introduced as someone who plays the flute. I had other identity of coming from swaraj uni or working with diabetes but nobody would remember that and everyone would just attach me to the flute. It was quite intimidating and exciting at the same time. I played at many occasions and people liked it. Finally I consider myself musician enough to be learning music. Writing this I can see the obvious contradictions but it’s all emotionally ingrained.   


###DHOLAVIRA मोहभंग
There is an aura around some people and places that makes me a better person for those times. I’m more joyful, in the moment, without judgment towards self or others and become highly creative. And I have always sought that aura. One of the prime reasons to go to such exotic places is to feel inspired. In this journey I was to see Dholavira, the 5000 yr old Harrapan metropolis unearthed by archeologists. I expected to be mightly inspired by being there.
I wasn’t even impressed to see Dholavira. It was all a duh feeling. And every time I would return from somewhere - the song – बाहर क्यूँ भटके मेरे मन में बजने लगेगा। And I would smile. Why am I wandering so much. It is not required anymore. What I need I can find within me. Return to your home and practice. 
Now this is a great feeling, it is so liberating - a weight of wandering, of wanderlust, of seeing exotic places had disappeared. And that’s what it had slowly become, a weight. Even meeting people for that matter. Of course I enjoyed it. But this wandering had become a part of my identity. Like the time I ran after ranks and merit lists to seek my identity and my self esteem. And one day it disappeared. I knew didn’t have to get these ranks to feel good about myself.
Now I knew I didn’t have to visit these exotic places or meet these inspiring people to find myself. They may help but It wasn’t necessary.
However I completely understand that this new thought wouldn’t come into practice suddenly. It will take time and I have plenty of it - there is nothing else to do. 


###PURPOSELESS IN BHUJ
By the night of 7th day into my journey, I was standing at Bhuj Bus Stand, contemplating what to do. I could find a guest house and sleep for the night. The next day, I could do sightseeing around Bhuj, visit organisations like Hunarshala and Khamir (which worked in natural material building and folk music respectively). Also if I wait for a day or two, I might get a chance to spend time with Nur Mohammad – the algoza player who collaborates with Mooralala. I started looking for a guest house. I was about to pay money when I decided to walk out. I didn’t have any real purpose anymore in Bhuj. No point wandering. बाहर क्यूँ भटके? I walked to the railway station to make sure this is what I want to do. And I got onto the train to Ahmedabad. That night was one of the most comfortable sleep in railways. That too in the general coach!

###WHERE DO WE SEEK LEARNING?
One afternoon as I waited at Dholavira for the bus out of Khadir bet I was called in by the village locals. They asked why I had come there and what I carried (my flute)? I told them about mooralala and my trip. Slowly more people started gathering in the chowk. They made me play the flute. Everyone appreciated it and clapped. I felt excited. Although one guy (the only one with spectacles) spoke in clear hindi – “अगर मैं ऐसा वघाडता(बजाता) तो यह सब मुझसे बांसुरी छीन लेते। आप बाहर से हो।” और हंसने लगा। मैं भी हंसने लगा। सोच रहा था पता नहीं इनको सही में पसंद आया था या नहीं। पर गाँव के लोग झूठी ताली तो नहीं बजते हैं न? खैर और बातें होने लगीं। tourism, education, city vs. village etc. As I was leaving, one guy said – “आप हमारे इलाके में सीखने आए यह जानकार बहुत अच्छा लगा। नहीं तो हम तो यही सोचते हैं की हमारे पास कुछ नहीं है और हमें सीखने के लिए दिल्ली-बंबई जाना चाहिए।” and I too was surprised by this fact. Mooralal was also sad that nobody in the next generation wanted to learn the folk music. His daughters and nephew had also lost interest. Here I was crossing half the country to learn from him and people around him didn’t appreciate the treasures around them. Strange no?
People said its risky to go into arts. The guy with spectacles commented, “it might be risky, but risk is my fashion (did he mean passion?)”  

###OTHER THOUGHTS/VIEWS ON MUSIC
_The anand idol guy_ – I am self trained in music. But I have to go much ahead in music, अभी मैं आकार नहीं गा पाता हूँ। job के कारण practice का टाइम ही नहीं मिलता है।
_The girl who has fallen in love with learning Bengali_ – मैंने दो साल गुजरात के सबसे prestigious क्लासिकल स्कूल में गाना सीखा। पर अब मैं उससे दूर हूँ। अब मुझे कोई ऐसा teacher चाहिए जो दोस्त के जैसा हो जो मेरा confidence बढ़ाए। भली मैं बेसुरा गाउँ पर जो गाउँ confidence और खुशी से गाउँ।
_The huge guy who just wouldn’t sing_ – मुझे चिल्ला चिल्ला कर बेसुरा गाना पसंद है। अभी यहाँ सब अच्छे से गा रहे हैं। यह मेरी जगह नहीं।
_The girl who could sing classical taans while driving in Ahmedabad traffic_ – expressing exact emotions of a raag is still way ahead. I have been practicing for 12 years. I still don’t get it. My teacher says, if you feel the emotion strongly enough, it will manifest.

### FIRST TIMES
This journey was the first time I -
Went to kutch; Did garba ; Dreamed of keeping a goat someday; Flute practice in train; 
Surya namaskar at railway platforms; Tuned an ektara 
Walked down 2km playing harmonica on full blast on a posh market road in Ahmedabad

## POEMS
.............

संगीत को न मुश्किल बना,

बहने दे लहरने दे,

लहरों को कलाबाजियों की जरूरत नहीं 

लहर को वापिस आना जरूरी है,

रास्ता चाहे सीधा हो,

चाल को ताल जरूरी है.



..............

क्यों मिलें फिर से हम,

तनहाईं को पूरा करने की कोशिश फिर करेंगे

थोड़ा तुम गाउगे

थोड़ा मैं

थोड़ा फिर खो जाएँगे हम

वक्त होगा लौटने का फिर

मिलने का वादा हम करेंगे

और लेकर अपनी तनहाई फिर बह जाएँगे। 



...............

नाम भटकू है अपनाया

काम भटकना है पाया

ढूँढूँ मैं किधर इधर

क्या है जो मुझे फाया

कभी भटका मन में

न जाने किस घट में

पर न पाई कस्तुरी

यही खोज हमेशा अधूरी

ढूँढूँ उसे जो कर दे मुझे पूरी

यही है मेरी मगरूरी

##THE PATH AHEAD?

“Practice, practice – All is coming.” As my friend Denise Charbo says.
Music and especially flute is a thing I want to spend a lot of time in my 20s. 2016-17 I have decided to work at Sehatvan. Growing food forest, making my body healthier and doing music will be core focus. I feel if I can sincerely practice them they can combine and help me seek my next adventure in life.
